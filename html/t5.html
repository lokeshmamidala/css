        Charles Leclerc is a Mon√©gasque Formula 1 driver currently racing for Scuderia Ferrari, wearing car number 16. Born in 1997, Leclerc rose quickly through the ranks of motorsport, winning the GP3 Series in 2016 and the Formula 2 Championship in 2017. He made his Formula 1 debut with Sauber in 2018, impressing with his pace and earning a promotion to Ferrari in 2019. Since then, Leclerc has established himself as one of the most talented drivers on the grid, known for his sharp qualifying performances and aggressive racecraft. He has secured 8 Grand Prix victories and over 25 pole positions, including a historic win at his home race in Monaco in 2024‚Äîbecoming the first-ever Monegasque driver to do so.

In the 2025 season, Leclerc has remained consistent, with multiple podium finishes despite Ferrari struggling with car performance. He is currently ahead of his teammate Lewis Hamilton in the driver standings. Although Ferrari‚Äôs SF-25 car has faced balance and reliability issues, Leclerc continues to extract the most from it, even pushing the team to experiment with extreme setup changes. Off the track, Charles is known for his calm demeanor and love for music‚Äîespecially playing piano, which he says helps him relax amid the high-pressure world of F1. Despite rumours of potential exits, Leclerc has remained loyal to Ferrari, aiming to bring the legendary team back to championship-winning form.
